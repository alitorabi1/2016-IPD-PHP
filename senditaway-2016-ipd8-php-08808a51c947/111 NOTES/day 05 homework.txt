day 5 homework

1. modify index.php so that
if user is logged in then
next to articles authored by
currently logged user you display link "edit".

link leads to articleaddedit.php?id=11


2. modify articleaddedit.php

If user attempts to edit article they did not author
they should be denied access to it.

Make modifications to allow editing if 'id' parameter
is supplied on the URL.

Note: when form submits via POST
you will still be able to access $_GET['id'];


3. In articleview.php allow user to add comments via POST form
if the user is logged in - as per provided mockup in PDF.

If user is not logged in then comment text box does
not show but instead a link "you must register or login to post comments"
